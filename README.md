# UNIX-SHELL

I created this shell for an academic project (Operating System).

It includes:
<pre>
    Basic commands like ls,pwd,etc. using <i>execvp()</i>.
    Piping and Redirection.
    Built-In commands like history,cd.
    Getting previous commands written using up and down arrow keys as in a linux shell.</pre>
